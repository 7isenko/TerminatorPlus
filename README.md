# PlayerAI [v3.0]

welcome, young one. yes, this is what will become the official release of the long awaited HorseNuggets 1,000 terminator manhunt plugin.

## Some basic stuff

This plugin requires [Spigot 1.16.5](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-16-5). NMS 1.17 kind of screwed up a lot of the EntityPlayer variable names so I don't really wanna have to deal with that yet.

## Things that are left to do

Some of the main things we are working on includes, but are not limited to:
- [ ] Complete bot physics, world interaction
- [ ] Public methods on the Bot class to simulate player actions
- [ ] Assignable AI types and learning profile data
- [ ] A GUI to view currently loaded bots and cool data with them
